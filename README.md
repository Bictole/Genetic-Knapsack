# Genetic-Knapsack

The Knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization.
Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.

It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items.

This repository contains an interesting solution with an algorithm that use some "genetic" property and mechanism.
